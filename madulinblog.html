            <li>**User Interface (UI):** Developing the visual elements—colors, typography, and layout—to ensure applications are engaging and easy to navigate.</li>
            <li>**Web Design and Development:** Gaining proficiency in frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to build responsive and modern websites.</li>
            <li>**Graphic Fundamentals:** Understanding basic principles of visual communication used in application mockups, reports, and digital content creation.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>

          <big><b>Education Meets Technology</b></big>
          <p>
